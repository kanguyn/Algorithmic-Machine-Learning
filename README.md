# Algorithmic-Machine-Learning: Jupyter Notebooks
Notebooks done in my course Algorithmic Machine Learning at EURECOM in Spring 2018, with prof. Pietro Michiardi.

They include 2 labs and a challenge:
* lab 1: Music Recommender System
* lab 2: Estimate Financial Risk through Monte Carlo Simulation
* challenge: one-month challenge on predicting house prices, based on a Kaggle challenge

## Details
* _Language_: Python over Jupyter Notebooks.
* _Execution_: set over a remote Spark cluster in [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr), managed by [Zoe](http://zoe-analytics.eu/)
* _Libraries_: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyspark

## Authors 
* Albane Bonnaud
* Kim-Anh-Nhi Nguyen @kanguyn
