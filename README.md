# Algorithmic-Machine-Learning: Jupyter Notebooks
Notebooks done in my course Algorithmic Machine Learning at EURECOM in Spring 2018, with prof. Pietro Michiardi.

They include 2 labs and a challenge:
* lab 1: Music Recommender System
* lab 2: Estimate Financial Risk through Monte Carlo Simulation
* challenge: one-month challenge on predicting house prices, based on a Kaggle challenge
